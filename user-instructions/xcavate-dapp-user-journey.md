**1.0 Connecting Wallets**

To interact with the Xcavate dApp, the Real Estate Developer and all other user must have already gone through the DID/KYC/KYB/AML (Kilt DID & Deloitte Verifiable Credentials) process (and be whitelisted - this is a work around until the Kilt DIP pallet is active) in order to be able to call the extrinsics of the Community Loan pallet, NFT Marketplace pallet & Staking pallet.

\
We have created a number of test accounts with DID’s and verifiable credentials.

\
Please go to this page [(click this link)](https://github.com/BTE-Trusted-Entity/sporran-extension/blob/main/docs/external.md) to set up the Sporran wallet / DIDs / Credentials prior to proceeding.

\
You will also need to create Talisman or Polkadot.js wallets from the seed phrases.

\
**2.0 User Accounts**

There are four types of user accounts. If a user has passed KYC, KYB & AML then they choose an account.

**2.1 Real Estate Developer**

Test Account 4 = Bob Builder (Real Estate Developer)... he has already been KYC, KYB (for his company) & AML checked so his account is active.

\
Once you have setup Bob’s Sporran & Talisman / Polkadot.js wallet then you can connect to his account.
