# Introduction

Xcavate is the web3 future of real estate build finance and property investment, by bringing together small to medium sized real estate developers directly with retail investors, in a trustless and permissionless environment.

This documentation is aimed to help you build and test the Xcavate node by adding the ink! smart contract, which allows a real estate developer to borrow using their physical land (which is minted as an NFT) against a build loan that is pre-approved by the Xcavate community technical committee.

The Xcavate community loan pool is an on-chain fund, which provides a source of liquidity for real estate developments and an opportunity for XCAV token holders to stake in the community loan pool.
