Creating a fairer, trustless and more sustainable real estate investment web3 future.

Total global Real Estate was valued at over $378.7 trillion at the end of 2022 yet only 1.1% of the global population own half of all the world's wealth.

Nearly 40% of global carbon dioxide emissions come from the real estate sector.

An estimated 150 million people are homeless globally, though the real number is probably higher.

The Xcavate Protocol tackles these issues by leveraging the power of blockchain technology as a Parachain / Appchain on Polkadot. Our protocol uses; digital identity (Kilt), custom substrate pallets, tokenisation (NFTs) and oracles (Acurast) to introduce transparency, security, accessibility and sustainability to the real estate market, while still being fully legally compliant.
