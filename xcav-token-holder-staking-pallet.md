# XCAV token holder staking pallet

1.  The user can stake their XCAV tokens by calling the stake function of the Xcavate staking pallet and by entering the amount to be staked. The user generates staking rewards during the time their XCAV tokens are staked (only if there are active loans during the staking period). To check if this works we can have a look at the account section and see if the staked value got locked.

2.  To un-stake the tokens, initiate the un-stake function, which will unlock the tokens (along with any rewards) by only entering the value that is needed to be un-staked.&#x20;
