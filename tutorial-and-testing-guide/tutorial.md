##Browsing

Any realXchange dApp user is able to browse all projects in the marketplace. If you wish to create a new project, then you will need to go through KYC/KYB/AML by creating a Kilt DID and purchasing verifiable credentials (from Deloitte), connect your wallet and be verified. If you wish to purchase any NFTs then DID/KYC/AML would be required by connecting your Deloitte (Sporran in this test environment) wallet and having your credentials verified.

For the purpose of this test environment, we have created several test accounts, that have be whitelisted (once the DIP pallet from Kilt has been set up this will bve an automoated and decentralised process).
